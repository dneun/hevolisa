HEvoLisa is a Haskell port of the EvoLisa program which can be found here:

[Genetic Programming: Evolution of Mona Lisa - Roger Alsing Weblog].

The original source code (C#) can be found in the FAQ section.

Current status: The evolution part is pretty stable. I finally got the
rendering part working with a current development version of
gtk2hs. The gtk2hs method imageSurfaceGetData (Surface -> ByteString)
is essential for the color error implementation. It is currently only
available in the development version of gtk2hs. The number of
evolutionary steps can be defined and after the execution of the steps 
the current polygon drawing is written to a PNG file.

TODO List

-> profiling, optimize performance
-> update haddock documentation
-> upload to hackage

The Future

-> await the next stable release of gtk2hs
-> create a nice GUI (at the moment there is no user interface)
-> Vectorisation/ GHC/Data Parallel Haskell for the error function
