The source code (C#) can be found in the FAQ section.

The evolution and mutation part is almost finished. Right now I`m
trying to build gtk2hs to get the cairo haskell bindings working. I`m still
having problems building gtk+ 2.8.9. I need the cairo bindings to do the
rendering of polygons and to load the source image.
