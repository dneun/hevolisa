HEvoLisa is a Haskell port of the EvoLisa program which can be found here:

The source code (C#) can be found in the FAQ section.

The evolution and mutation part is almost finished. Right now I`m
trying to build gtk2hs to get the cairo haskell bindings working. I`m still
having problems building gtk+ 2.8.9. I need the cairo bindings to do the
rendering of polygons and to load the source image.

Update: I managed to build and install Cairo/GTK after two days of
tedious tweaking of makefiles, library paths and compiler options. I
hope that I can implement the polygon rendering during the next days.
