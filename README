HEvoLisa is a Haskell port of the EvoLisa program which can be found here:

[Genetic Programming: Evolution of Mona Lisa - Roger Alsing Weblog].

The source code (C#) can be found in the FAQ section.

Current status: The evolution part is pretty stable. I finally got the
rendering part working with a current development version of
gtk2hs. The gtk2hs method imageSurfaceGetData (Surface -> ByteString)
is essential for the color error implementation. It is currently only
available in the development version of gtk2hs. The number of
evolutionary steps can be defined and after the execution of the steps 
the current polygon drawing is written to a file.

TODO List

-> optimize performance - the image is currently loaded in every step
-> create a nice GUI (at the moment there is no user interface)
-> update haddock documentation
-> upload to hackage
